<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Aspiring developer by day, WingStop connoseuir by night</h3>

<p>Hi, my name is Blake! I'm a 32 year old web developer/tech enthusiast from Baltimore, MD that probably has a unnatural addiction to WingStop. In my spare time, my hobbies are video games, playing guitar, researching interesting topics/facts, movies, and of course crafting my own websites and programs! Check out my recent projects and if you have any questions or want to drop a WingStop gift card, head on over to my <a href="contact.html">Contact me</a> page!</p>

<p>PEACE!</p>
